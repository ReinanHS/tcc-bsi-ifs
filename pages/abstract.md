# Abstract

Programming is one of the most popular and important areas of information technology. For this reason, many people seek 
an education in programming courses. However, learning to program can be a difficult, stressful and frustrating task 
for beginners. This is due to the need for memorization and repetition.

In this context, this paper aims to develop and evaluate a prototype of an online learning platform that takes advantage 
of gamification elements to encourage students to learn and solve logic programming problems through challenging missions. 
Students are more motivated since their actions would result in rewards, achievements, and levels that correlate
with their performance.
